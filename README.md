# Jot - Your Daily Tracker and Journaling App

Jot is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help you keep track of your daily activities and thoughts. I built it out of my own desire to remember and regret less.

Try it out! https://jot.regretless.life/

## Features

- **Flexible Activity and Mood Tracking**: Keep track of your daily activities and moods with ease and however you find useful
